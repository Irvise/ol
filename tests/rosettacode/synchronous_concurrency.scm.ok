read line: No stain yet on the Moon was seen,
read line: No words were laid on stream or stone
read line: When Durin woke and walked alone.
read line: He named the nameless hills and dells;
read line: He drank from yet untasted wells;
read line: He stooped and looked in Mirrormere,
read line: And saw a crown of stars appear,
read line: As gems upon a silver thread,
read line: Above the shadows of his head.
