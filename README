OVERVIEW
~~~~~~~~

Otus Lisp is a purely (/mostly/) functional dialect of Lisp. It
implements an extended subset of R5RS Scheme. It is small,
embeddable and crossplatform.
It can call and be called by native applications and libraries.


REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For un*x you should have GCC installed.
For windows you should have MINGW installed.
For un*x you maybe want MAKE installed too.

Minimal appropriate gcc version is 3.2.


BUILD
~~~~~

SIMPLE WAY

   $ make; make install

* gmake for unix and *bsd clients


MORE INTERESTING WAYS

Linux way

To build OL for linux platform
   $ gcc src/olvm.c src/boot.c  -std=c99 -O2  -o ol -ldl

To build only olvm (virtual machine) for linux x86 platform,
that can execute only compiled (binary) lisp scripts
   $ gcc src/olvm.c -DNAKED_VM  -std=c99 -O2  -o vm -ldl

* to select 32- or 64-bit platform please add "-m32" or "-m64" to
  the command line


OLvm can execute only precompiled OL scripts (see BINARY SCRIPTS
section) and is very small (about 35KB).
Full OL with interpreter that can execute text lisp scripts more
fat (about 400KB executable).


Windows way

   > set PATH=%PATH%;C:\MinGW\bin
   > gcc.exe src\olvm.c src\boot.c -IC:\MinGW\include\ -LC:\MinGW\lib\ -std=c99 -O2  -o ol
Same for "naked" olvm
   > set PATH=%PATH%;C:\MinGW\bin
   > gcc.exe src\olvm.c -DNAKED_VM -IC:\MinGW\include\ -LC:\MinGW\lib\ -std=c99 -O2  -o ol


FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD way

   BSD require including "c" library instead of dl:

   $ gcc src/olvm.c src/boot.c  -std=c99 -O2  -o ol -lc
   $ gcc src/olvm.c -DNAKED_VM  -std=c99 -O2  -o vm -lc


Android way
   tbd.

MacOS/iOS way
   tbd.

Open webOS way
   Put toolchain/ol.bb bitbake receipe into any place of open webOs receipes folder (i.e.
   ./meta-oe/) and run "make ol" from root open webOs folder.
   Upload ol executable from BUILD/work/<build-name>/ol/1.0.0-1-r0/build to machine /bin.
   Now you cat execute ol under webos command line or other way you would like.


VERY INTERESTING WAY

   You can change OL scheme language (yes, you can) by editing sources in
   lang/ and owl/ subfolders.

To build OL language (not OL virtual machine)
   $ make recompile
   This will create new (in successfull way) repl binary that contains ol interpreter code

   Few words about OL can be found in documentation on the project page.


SPEEDUP
~~~~~~~

You can disable most internal checks for speedup by editing the  olvm.h  header
file, for example you can uncomment "#define CAR_CHECK(arg) 1" macro to disable
the virtual machine internal checks for pair validness. But it  can  make  olvm
less stable!


ADDITIONAL OL VM FEATURES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To force build OL with sockets (linux and windows) support
   add -DHAS_SOCKETS to gcc command line
    or set appropriate define in src/olvm.h to 1
   add -lws2_32 for Windows

To force build OL with dlopen/dlsym (LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress for windows) support
   add -DHAS_DLOPEN and -ldl to gcc command line
    or set appropriate define in src/olvm.h to 1

   please note, that opengl/sqlite/other libs requires this define enabled to 1

To force build OL with pinvoke (Platform Invoke mechanism) support
   add -DHAS_PINVOKE to gcc command line
    or set appropriate define in src/olvm.h to 1

   please note, that opengl/sqlite/other libs requires this define enabled to 1

To build OL as embedded in your project interpreter
   add -DEMBEDDED_VM to gcc command line

   more information about embedded OL can be found in EMBEDDED OL section.



INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create .deb packet for linux-64 (tested under Ubuntu 14.04) using
   $ make debian-amd64-package

No automatic installation for windows still yet, you must manually copy 'ol' executable
to any appropriate place, for example
   > copy ol.exe C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND

For un*x simply type
   $ make install


RUNNING
~~~~~~~

There are few ways to execute ol

Interactive mode
   $ ol
   You see a prompt.
   Type ',help' to help, ',quit' to end session
   > (+ 1 2 3)                      # now you in REPL and can play with in
   6
   > ,quit                          # this ends interactive session
   bye bye _o/~

Unattended mode
   $ ol scriptname.ol                # text script
   $ ol scriptname.bl                # binary (compiled) script
   $ echo '(print (+ 1 2 3))' | ol
For windows
   > echo (print (+ 1 2 3)) | ol


BINARY SCRIPTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OL can execute precompiled scripts.
You can compile your script by using this code
--- cut ---
(define (main)
   #true ; anything you want to compile
)
(vector->file (list->vector (fasl-encode (lambda (args)
   (main)))) "out.bl")
--- cut ---
where "out.bl" your output file name

As result will be create binary script, that can be executed directly by ol
or vm:
---cut ---
0000000000: 02 10 0C 19 02 00 07 01 | 01 02 05 02 05 01 11 02
0000000010: 10 09 19 01 00 04 8D 04 | 18 04 11 01 11 02 02 01
0000000020: 00                      |
---cut ---

Now you can execute this code by OL as full OL or as "naked" OLvm
   $ ol out.bl


FILES
~~~~~~

   src/olvm.h  - the OL virtual machine header
   src/olvm.c  - the OL vm
   src/boot.c  - the OL interpreter/compiler
   lang/*.scm  - implementation of OL repl and compiler
   owl/*.scm   - implementation of OL libraries
   r5rs/*.scm  - r5rs compliant OL language part
   tests/*.scm - some automated tests


TRICKS
~~~~~~

Register interpreter in the ms windows:
assoc .ol=OLisp.File
ftype OLisp.File=ol "%1" %*
assoc .bl=OLisp.Binary.File
ftype OLisp.Binary.File=ol "%1" %*

Register interpreter in the linux:
#!/usr/bin/ol


USAGE
~~~~~

OL (Otus Lisp) can be used either interactively, or to interpret code
from files, or compile programs to fasl-images. The difference between
an ol program and a plain script is that the program should just have
a function of one argument as the last value, which will be called with
the command line argument list when the program is executed.


EMBEDDED OL
~~~~~~~~~~~
OL can be embedded in your project. More info can be found in docs.

This is usage sample:
--- cut ---
// embedded example
#include "olvm_xtra.h"

__attribute__((__visibility__("default")))
word* sample_add(OL* ol, word arguments) {
    word* fp; // memory pointer
    fp = ol->fp;

    word* fa = (word*)car(arguments); arguments = cdr(arguments);
    word* fb = (word*)car(arguments); arguments = cdr(arguments);

    // math
    int a = sftoi(fa);
    int b = sftoi(fb);
    int r = a + b;
    // result
    word* result = F(r);

    ol->fp = fp;//
    return result;
}

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    return vm_new(
        "(import (otus pinvoke) (owl io))"
        "(define % (dlopen))" // get own handle
        "(define sample_add (dlsym+ % \"sample_add\"))"
        "(print \"sample_add: \""
        "   (sample_add 1 2))"
        "(halt 1)", 0);
}

--- cut ---

You can call your own functions from OL code.
Currently this is more complecated. You need:
   a) compile OL with -DHAS_DLOPEN and -DHAS_PINVOKE options
      (don't forget for -DEMBEDDED_VM)
   b) send to vm "(import (otus pinvoke))" (owl/pinvoke.scm must
      be accessible from your executable)
   c) send to vm "(define me (dload))" where "me" is some
      appropriate variable name or you can use "let, let*" or
      any other construction you like
Now you have two variants - embed OL function or simple C function call.
For embed OL function call you must
   d) declare you function for OL like this
      '(define myFuction (dlsym+ me "functionname"))'
      in this code
      *) "functionname" - function name string. you must export this
         function from your code to make it accessible from OL
      Now your function will receive OL* as furst parameter. This structure
      provides memory pointer and you have low-level access to OL scructures.
      This mechanism will help to provide you OL language native extensions, in
      feature structure will extent by help functions.

For normal C function call (actually platform invoke mechanism) you must
   d) declare you function for OL (via vm_puts, sure) like this
      '(define myFuction (dlsym me type-int+ "functionname" type-string type-int+))'
      in this code
      *) myFunction - any appropriate variable name for your function
         internal OL script name. This variable will associated with
         lambda that can be called in further code.
      *) second argument in (dlsym) is return type of native function
         available types you can check in owl/pinvoke.scm
      *) third (dlsym) arg is function name string. you must export this
         function from your code to make it accessible from OL
      *) other (dlsym) args is argument types for native function, pinvoke
         will try to convert arguments of myFunction lambda to this type.
         available types can be checked in owl/pinvoke.scm too.

         Small comment for this: if you want to get number - let use type-int+,
         if you expect SMALL number - let use type-fix+. No differences between
         types with + and with - are present.
   e) well, now you can freely use your native function like this for example
      '(print (myFunction "str1" 123))'

More information about pinvoke you can get in source files
   lib/sqlite.scm
   lib/opengl.scm and OpenGL/version-X-X.scm
   lib/winapi.scm
   lib/x11.scm

* All embedded OL api in progress and can be changed in feature.
