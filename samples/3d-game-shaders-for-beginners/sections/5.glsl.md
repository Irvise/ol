```scheme
(import (OpenGL version-2-1))
```

We use OpenGL 2.1 as a very simple and straightforward graphics library frontend. No preparations of index and vertex buffers, no calculations of buffers length, no many low-level technical moves - just begin, set a vertex, set a normal, end.

---
```scheme
(define models (prepare-models "cache.bin"))
```

We load the models cache (generated from wavefront OBJ and MTL files) and immediately compile the geometry as [OpenGL lists](https://www.glprogramming.com/red/chapter07.html).
As a result we got a model-name->list-of-opengl-lists dictionary with compiled geometry to be rendered using glCallList(s).

---
```scheme
(define scene (read-json-file "scene1.json"))
```

Load a scene.

---
```scheme
(define po (gl:CreateProgram
"#version 120 // OpenGL 2.1
   void main() {
      gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_TextureMatrix[0] * gl_Vertex;
      gl_FrontColor = gl_Color;
   }"
"#version 120 // OpenGL 2.1
   void main() {
      gl_FragColor = gl_Color;
   }"))
```

Create a simplest OpenGL shader that draws a basic geometry without any processing. Draw every model colored and in the right place. No lights, no shadows, no postprocessing.

Note: We use gl_TextureMatrix[0] as a "local" model matrix, a part of a real Model matrix. This is for our modular application architecture: each same part of the scene (like a floor or wall) is a separate object having the same compiled model. To move an objects onto desired place, we use a "local" model matrix built from the object's 'location' and 'rotation' properties.

So full modelview matrix is a gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_TextureMatrix[0].

---
```
(define camera (ref (scene 'Cameras) 1))
...
(gluPerspective angle (/ (gl:get-window-width) (gl:get-window-height)) 0.1 100)
...
(gluLookAt
   (ref location 1) (ref location 2) (ref location 3)
   (ref target 1) (ref target 2) (ref target 3)
   0 0 1))
```

Setup a scene camera. Use first camera from the scheme json.

---
```
(draw-geometry scene models)
```

Draw a geometry.
