```scheme
(import (OpenGL version-2-1))
```

We use OpenGL 2.1 as a very simple and straightforward graphics library frontend. No preparations of index and vertex buffers, no calculations of buffers length, no many low-level technical moves - just begin, set a vertex, set a normal, end.

---

```scheme
(define models (prepare-models "cache.bin"))
```

We load the models cache (generated from wavefront OBJ and MTL files) and immediately compile the geometry as OpenGL lists.
As a loading result we got a model-name->list-of-opengl-lists dictionary with compiled geometry to be rendered using glCallList(s).

---

```scheme
(define scene (read-json-file "scene1.json"))
```

Load a scene.

---

```
   (draw-geometry scene models)
```

Draw a geometry.
