; fasl protocl for inter-owl/process communication:
;	- each message is a fasl-encoded object
;	- all protocol-messages are plain owl objects
;		+ therefore, the this will work mostly like if the things
;       were running on the same machine and/or process
;	- remote execution keeps *no* sharing state.
;		+ all threads are self-contained, and must be able to 
;       migrate elsewhere at any point (modulo io)
;  - evaluator node operation:
;		+ contains a thread scheduler and one thread handling thread
;       and object migration
;		+ has a mapping of local thread ids to their origins
;		+ when a thread finishes (or crashes) serialize the result and send to origin with id
;	 	+ when a new thread is received
;			- choose a new thread identifier for it (fixnum)
;			- fork it 
;			- send #(1 <id>) as reponse
;	- evaluator messages
;		+ #(1 <id>) - reponse - thread forked 
;		+ #(2 <id>) - request - ask if the thread is runnign
;		+ #(3 <id>) - request - kill a thread (if running)
;	- evaluator has a list of fds for active communication
;		+ for a locally forked evaluator, just stdin and stdout 
;		+ a server node has a socket to which it accepts connections
;		+ authenticated things talk over a stream-ciphered channel, etc, with the same requests
;		+ when a connection closes, all requests started by it are also closed (by default)
